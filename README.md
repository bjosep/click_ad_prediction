# Click Ad Prediction

- The objective of this project is to predict if a given user will click on an advertisement or not. 
It can be framed as a supervised machine learning problem (binary classification)

- The performance is measured using the model recall.

- The best model in terms of performance is a logistic regression with the following parameters:<br>
'C'= 10 and  'penalty'= 'l2'. Its corresponding test set recall is 0.96

- This repository contains a jupyter notebook of the conducted steps: exploratory data analysis, feature engineering (numerical and categorical), models hyper-parameters tuning, model evaluation
